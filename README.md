# Ebenezer 🪨

This project provides a variety of widgets and behaviors designed for desktop environments or any window manager. Currently, it is being used with Hyprland. The initial implementation was [Qtile Ebenezer](https://github.com/williampsena/qtile-ebenezer), and the plan is to transition CLI commands from Python to this project for enhanced integration and functionality.

# The Name

The theme is named Ebenezer 🪨, meaning "stone of help." The name originates from I Samuel 7, where Samuel raises his Ebenezer after defeating the Philistines, declaring that God had helped them overcome their enemies. The phrase "hither by thy help I come" reflects the hope that this project will assist you in your environment and, more importantly, in your life. 🙏🏿
