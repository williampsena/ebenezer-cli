# Ebenezer 🪨

This project offers a range of widgets and behaviors, from Desktop or Any Window Manager.

Now I'm using this with Hyprland. The initial implementation was [Qtile Ebenezer](https://github.com/williampsena/qtile-ebenezer), and I plan to transition CLI commands from Python to this project for better integration and functionality.

# The name.

This theme was named Ebenezer 🪨, which meaning "stone of helper.".

    The quote is from I Samuel 7. After defeating the Philistines, Samuel raises his Ebenezer, declaring that God defeated the enemihttps://github.com/williampsena/qtile-ebenezeres on this spot. As a result, "hither by thy help I come." So I hope this stone helps you in your environment and, more importantly, in your life. 🙏🏿
